I am a postdoctoral researcher in computational neuroscience and machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University, working with [Byron Yu](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~byronyu/) and [Matthew Smith](https://smithlab.net/). My research centers on understanding the dynamics of prefrontal cortex populations and their link to computation. For this, I use a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches including neurophysiology, neuroengineering, computational modeling and machine learning.

I obtained a PhD in Theoretical Neuroscience and Machine Learning from the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/) at University College London under the supervision of [Maneesh Sahani](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~maneesh/). Previously, I completed a MSc in Neural Systems and Computation at the [Institute of Neuroinformatics](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en.html), at ETH-Zurich and the University of Zurich, where I worked under the supervision of [Valerio Mante](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en/research/groups/mante.html).
