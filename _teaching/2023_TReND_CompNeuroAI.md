* I was responsible for the conceptualization and organization of this summer school, as well as coordinating the teaching program. I also taught a machine learning tutorial on dimensionality reduction techniques for neural data analysis.

All teaching materials are available open source at our TReND public [Github repository](https://github.com/trendinafrica/Comp_Neuro-ML_course/). The dimensionality reduction tutorial can also be found [there](https://github.com/trendinafrica/Comp_Neuro-ML_course/tree/main/notebooks/19-Monday/).
