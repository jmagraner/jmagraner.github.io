Joana Soldado-Magraner
Dr. Joana Soldado-Magraner is a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Carnegie Mellon University working on basic neuroscience research and its applications to neuroengineering. She uses tools from computational neuroscience and machine learning to reveal fundamental aspects of neural computation. She then uses uses these principles to design novel neural interfaces that can effectively modulate neural activity and behavior. She holds a PhD in Theoretical Neuroscience and Machine Learning from the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, at University College London. She has led several training initiatives to make scientific education more open and accessible to all. Since 2020, she has been part of the IEEE Brain Neuroethics Medical Application group, were she has worked together with a highly multidisciplinar team to push forward novel neuroethics frameworks.
